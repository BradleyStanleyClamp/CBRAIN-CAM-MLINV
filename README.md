This is a fork of the work by Beucler .et al Climate-invariant Machine learning, looking at how we can learn invariant transformations in a data driven approach. 

Thank you for checking out this fork of the CBRAIN repository (https://github.com/raspstephan/CBRAIN-CAM), dedicated to building *physically-constrained and physically-informed* climate model parameterizations. This is a working fork in a working repository, which means that recent commits may not always be functional or documented. 

If you are looking for the version of the code that corresponds to the climate-invariant paper, check out this release:

## Repository description

The main components of the repository are:

- `cbrain`: Contains the cbrain module with all code to preprocess the raw data, run the neural network experiments and analyze the data.
- `pp_config`: Contains configuration files and shell scripts to preprocess the climate model data to be used as neural network inputs
- `nn_config`: Contains neural network configuration files to be used with `run_experiment.py`.
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used to analyze data. All plotting and data analysis for the papers is done in the subfolder `presentation`. `dev` contains development notebooks.
- `wkspectra`: Contains code to compute Wheeler-Kiladis figures. These were created by [Mike S. Pritchard](http://sites.uci.edu/pritchard/)
- `save_weights.py`: Saves the weights, biases and normalization vectors in text files. These are then used as input for the climate model.
